# RobotAPI

This VB.NET script interacts with the RSA API to save all the results to csv in a batch process.
First a command window prompt opens to ask the user to specify a project directory.
Next it sets all the dimensions and tables to the desired values
Then it dumps all the tables to csv, and encodes them such that LaTeX can handle them.

What doesn't work?
